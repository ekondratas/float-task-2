            Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural
            philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential
            men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
            Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most
            influential book in the history of science.

            Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of
            relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by
            the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
            Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for
            his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.
